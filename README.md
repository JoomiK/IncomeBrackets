### Predicting income brackets

Data: Income data from the UCI ML Repository  
Techniques: Classification, random forest

For this project I build quick models (using sklearn and H2O) to determine income bracket from imbalanced data- the income levels are binned at below 50k and above 50k.

### Documents:  
preprocessing.py contains functions for preprocessing data  
IncomeBrackets.ipynb contains the workflow
